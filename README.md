Published under GPL v3

The design goals are tried to be easy to make yet satble as possible.  The major style is inheritanted from box frame of Prusa i3.  Additional close-loop control and monitoring will be added later.  This is also serve as the prototype of recyclePhenox, a smaller one made of mostly recycled material.   

All models are in the box_frame folder, including models for aluminium single plate. For some common configs we prepared models, see box_frame/sample_stls.
